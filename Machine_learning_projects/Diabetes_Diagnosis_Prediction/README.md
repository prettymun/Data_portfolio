## 📌 Problem Statement

Can we predict whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on clinical measurements such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin?

Early and accurate prediction of diabetes enables healthcare providers to:
- Intervene earlier before complications develop
- Prioritise high-risk patients for immediate screening
- Allocate clinical resources more effectively
- Reduce the burden of late-stage diabetes management

## 📦 Dataset

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset |
| **Source** | National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) |
| **Records** | 768 patients |
| **Features** | 8 clinical measurements |
| **Target** | `Outcome` — 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not Diabetic |
| **Class Split** | 500 Not Diabetic (65.1%) · 268 Diabetic (34.9%) |

### Feature Descriptions

| Feature | Description | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `Pregnancies` | Number of times pregnant | count |
| `Glucose` | Plasma glucose concentration (2hr OGTT) | mg/dL |
| `BloodPressure` | Diastolic blood pressure | mmHg |
| `SkinThickness` | Triceps skin fold thickness | mm |
| `Insulin` | 2-hour serum insulin | µU/mL |
| `BMI` | Body mass index | kg/m² |
| `DiabetesPedigreeFunction` | Family history score | score |
| `Age` | Age of patient | years |

## 📓 Notebook Structure

The notebook is organised into 12 clearly labelled steps:

| Step | Section | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Install & Import Libraries | Set up pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |
| 02 | Load the Dataset | Pull data directly from URL — no manual download needed |
| 03 | Exploratory Data Analysis | Data types, statistical summary, missing values, class balance |
| 04 | Data Visualisation | Feature distributions, correlation heatmap, class-level comparisons |
| 05 | Data Preprocessing | Replace impossible zero values with median, feature scaling |
| 06 | Train / Test Split | 80/20 stratified split, StandardScaler applied |
| 07 | Logistic Regression | Baseline model — training, evaluation, confusion matrix |
| 08 | Random Forest | Ensemble model — training, evaluation, confusion matrix |
| 09 | Decision Tree | Tree-based model with visual tree structure |
| 10 | K-Nearest Neighbours | Distance-based model + optimal K selection |
| 11 | Model Comparison | Side-by-side bar chart across all 4 models |
| 12 | Feature Importance | Importance scores across all 3 tree/linear models |
| 13 | ROC Curve | All 4 models on one chart with AUC scores |
| 14 | Business Insights | Clinical findings and recommendations |

---

## 🤖 Models Trained

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** | Baseline classifier · uses scaled features · `class_weight='balanced'` |
| **Random Forest** | 100 decision trees · uses unscaled features · best overall balance |
| **Decision Tree** | `max_depth=5` to prevent overfitting · visualised with `plot_tree` |
| **KNN** | K optimised by testing K=1 to 30 · sensitive to feature scale |

---

## 📊 Results

> Exact scores will vary slightly depending on environment. Below are representative results from the training run.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | ~77% | ~72% | ~76% | ~74% | ~0.84 |
| **Random Forest** | **~76%** | **~71%** | **~72%** | **~71%** | **~0.83** |
| Decision Tree | ~72% | ~65% | ~70% | ~67% | ~0.76 |
| KNN | ~74% | ~68% | ~68% | ~68% | ~0.80 |

> **Why Recall matters most here:** In a clinical setting, a False Negative (missing a diabetic patient) is more costly than a False Positive (unnecessary follow-up). Models are evaluated with this priority in mind.

## 💡 Key Findings

1. **Glucose** is the strongest predictor of diabetes — consistently ranked #1 across all feature importance methods
2. **BMI** is the second most important factor, confirming the clinical link between obesity and Type 2 diabetes
3. **Age** and **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** are significant non-modifiable risk factors
4. **Insulin** and **SkinThickness** are the weakest predictors — partly due to high rates of zero/missing values in the original dataset
5. All 4 models significantly outperform random chance (AUC > 0.5)
